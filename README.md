# commitstats
Code stats for all my private and public code


Usage
-----

Install ``requirements.txt`` via pip, create ``secrets.py`` file from ``secrets_template.py``.

Run ``python update.py``, go watch some stupid movie, I tried Ant-man but it was terrible,
so I can't really recommend that.

Then simply open ``index.html`` in browser.
