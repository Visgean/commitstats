# commitstats
Code stats for all my private and public code

This will be updated by cron and served as static content. I plan to add Bitbucket repos as well.

Usage
-----

Install ``requirements.txt`` via pip, create ``secrets.py`` file from ``secrets_template.py``.

Run ``python update.py``, go watch some stupid movie, I tried Ant-man and boy it was really bad.
So that is basically the reason why I started this project, because the movie was so so stupid :(.
